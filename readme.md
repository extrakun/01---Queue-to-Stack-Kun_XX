# Queue to Stack

Complete the function `queueToStack` which given a queue, will return a new stack with the elements in the **same order** as the queue. This means, if the queue contains:

```
Front --> 1,4,8,10,12 
```

Then the resultant stack should also have `1` at the top of the stack.

```
Top --> 1,4,8,10,12
```

## Sample runs
```
Enter a sequence of numbers, separated by comma: 1,4,8,9,10
1
4
8
9
10
```
